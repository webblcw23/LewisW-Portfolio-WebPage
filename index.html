      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôm Lewis Webb, a Platform Engineer with over five years of experience in automating, maintaining, and supporting enterprise platforms ‚Äî and a real passion for cloud technologies and DevOps practices.</p>
      <p>After graduating from Glasgow Caledonian University with a 2:1 in Computer Games Design, I joined FDM Group, completing 14 weeks of intensive technical training before being placed at abrdn (formerly Aberdeen Asset Management and now Aberdeen).</p>
      <p>At abrdn, I spent over five years building and optimising large-scale platforms ‚Äî maintaining 200 + Windows Server environments, automating deployments through Azure DevOps, and scripting in PowerShell to streamline operations and batch processes. I worked closely with a large mix of teams to ensure reliability, efficiency for business-critical systems, helping deliver projects that supported over ¬£300bn in managed assets. One of my key achievements was automating configuration deployments across 200+ servers for the CRIMS 21r1 upgrade from 18r2, cutting delivery time by 90% and reducing manual errors dramatically.</p>
      <p>Following redundancy in late 2024, I‚Äôve focused on upskilling into cloud engineering, earning my Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator (AZ-104) certification and developing real-world Azure projects. These include deploying production-style infrastructure in Azure with Terraform as IaC, building CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, and exploring containerisation through Docker and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). I continue to develop my skillset and create new projects as well as build upon my existing ones./p>
      <p>Now, I‚Äôm looking to bring together my strong foundation in on prem enterprise systems and my growing cloud expertise in a Cloud, Platform, or DevOps Engineer role ‚Äî where I can continue learning, contribute to modern infrastructure solutions, and help teams deliver reliable, automated platforms at scale.</p>
      <p>Please have a look at my project work in the Project section and I would love to speak futher on any job opportunities you might have - please find my contact details in the Contact section.</p>
